	<p><h2>What does it take to be an IBAer?</h2></p>
    <p><h2>What you need to be a full-fledged member:</h2>
   		<ul>
        	<li><h3>Be a current student at San Jose State University</h3></li>
    		<li><h3>Have a 3.0 and above GPA</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Attend at least 3 events (After registration, of course! All new members are registered under a probationary period and are subject to be dropped from the organization if participation does not happen by the end of the semester. Being dropped from the organization means you will not recieve any further perks, you will be removed from the LinkedIn IBA page, and no refund will be made for membership fees paid.)</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Pay the membership fee ($25 per semester, $40 per year)</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Be an open minded person </h3></li>
            <li><h3>Be ready to learn and make friends!</h3></li>
    	</ul>
        <p><h3>*Although the membership fee is mandatory, you don't need to pay the fee in order to participate in our events or come to our meetings. If you are unable to pay the fee for whatever reason, but would like to get the perks, you can speak privately to an officer or email us at iba.sjsu@gmail.com and we can have it waived as well.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>LinkedIn Group Membership: You must have attended 3 events (within one semester) before you are accepted into the LinkedIn group. The reason for this is that we get many requests from people who have never participated in the organization and we want the LinkedIn Membership be a way for us to recognize members who have actually contributed.</h3></p>
    </p>
    <p><h2>What you don't need:</h2>
    <h3>You don't need to be an International Business major<br>
		You don't even need to be a business major!</h3>
		<p><h3>Email us at iba.sjsu@gmail.com if you have any questions regarding our membership Policy!</h3></p>
    </p>
    <p><h2>How to pay for membership?</h2>
    <h3>In Person - You can turn in your membership money and details in a sealed envelope with your name, ID number, and email address to an officer at an official IBA meeting or whenever you see one on campus. Don't be shy! Just email or text us and we can meet! ;)</h3>
